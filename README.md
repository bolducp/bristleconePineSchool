## Development

We develop on the gh-pages branch.  Make sure you have the gh-pages branch checked out with:

```
git checkout gh-pages
```

To update your github repository from Paige's github version:

```
git pull upstream gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
```

To make changes, do the above, then make the changes you're interested in, then run:

```
git add .
git commit -m 'this is the commit message that explains what you have done'
git push origin gh-pages
```

Next, go to your github version of the repository and make a pull request.
